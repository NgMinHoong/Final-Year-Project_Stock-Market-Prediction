## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Compare ARIMA, LSTM, GRU, and hybrid models (LSTM-GRU, GRU-LSTM)
- Apply Random Search for hyperparameter tuning
- Predict daily closing prices of GOOG, AMZN, and MSFT
- Evaluate models using RMSE and RÂ²

## ðŸ“Š Datasets

Historical daily stock data were obtained from Yahoo Finance for GOOG, AMZN, and MSFT (10 years span).

## ðŸ§ª Models

| Model        | Description                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ARIMA        | Classical time series model for linear trends     |
| LSTM         | Long Short-Term Memory neural network             |
| GRU          | Gated Recurrent Unit network                      |
| LSTM-GRU     | Hybrid model with LSTM followed by GRU            |
| GRU-LSTM     | Hybrid model with GRU followed by LSTM            |

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)
